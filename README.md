# Caramello Camel Caser
> A slightly better than average camel caser

## Why is it slightly better than your average camel caser?
* **Average:** You can do normal camel casing with it
* **Average:** You can strip numbers and special characters from the result
* **Average:** You can capitalise the first letter of the returned result if that's your thing
* **Average:** You can use it to strip html, returning all the text on your page
* **Much Better Than Average:** Using all of the above, you can return an object of the text on the page with the *key* camel cased, but the *value* unchanged, cutting out the hours/days of tedious manual work in a site translation job.
